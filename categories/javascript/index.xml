      <description>Javascript Basics In my opinion, Javascript is a great language for beginners, because it is already installed in your browser!

Fast forward a few years, in the summer of my sophmore year of college (2010), I started to read about people building interesting things with something called an Arduino which is a microcontroller programmed with a language based on C.</description>
