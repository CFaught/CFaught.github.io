      <description>Anyone Can Learn to Code I believe that a lot of people approach the idea of programming with a bias built up from hearing about guys from MIT and Harvard starting revolutionary projects causing people to think that programmers need to be mathematicians or computer science majors to become competent at developing applications. And while it&amp;rsquo;s true that there are a lot of super smart people in the community who have pioneered the technology, there are also just as many average Joe&amp;rsquo;s out there with good ideas that are able to pick up programming and build great things.</description>

      <description>What is Programming? Before I get too deep into the details on the topic of programming, I want to talk a little bit about what programming is, what it is not, and why it is important in todays world. Programming is how we humans communicate specific instructions on how to do something to a computer. Programming is the tool that developers use to flesh out ideas for solving a problem.</description>

      <description>Some History In high school, I decided to take a class in Computer Science based in Java. At the time I was looking forward to making a game or something interesting, and was disenchanted when we delved into nothing but algorithims and data structures; I did, however learn a few things that would later become useful.
Fast forward a few years, in the summer of my sophmore year of college (2010), I started to read about people building interesting things with something called an Arduino which is a microcontroller programmed with a language based on C.</description>
